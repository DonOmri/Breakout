# Project 2: Breakout

Screen resolution: 4K

My mechanic intervention is:
-Settings that affect game difficulty and score multiplier
-High scores
-In-game pause menu
-Random level creation, and level re-creation when all bricks were broken
-Random potion drops from bricks and potion effects

GDD mechanics I changed/replaced/removed:
-Ball speed is changed:
  -Ball basic speed is controlled by user in Settings
  -Ball speed can be changed in-game using potions
  -Ball speed is changed after number of hits. Modifiable through Inspector

-Winning Condition is removed. Instead, the game recreates bricks randomly, and the player continues to play
until game over.
